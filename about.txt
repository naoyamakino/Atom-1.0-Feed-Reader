URL: http://cmpt470.csil.sfu.ca/~nmakino/a2/atomReader.rb

File Discription:
atomReader.rb: the main page that asks the user for the URL of an Atom feed
output.rb: this file takes URL and parses the XML to determine neccessary elements
new.eruby: eruby file that creates HTML file for the output
files/stylesheet.css: CSS file

Assumptions:
- the URL points to a valid Atom 1.0 feed, returing the page, formatted as a simple blog.

Comment:
- I cannot display a correct author's name in a corresponding entry as it only takes author's name when entry has a name. 
  Therefore, I am not able to keep track of which entry has a name.
- It is not able to display images.
- I have used the css file from this website: http://www.igvita.com/2007/03/22/agile-rss-aggregator-in-ruby/
- I modified news.eruby file from the above website to meet my needs.
- A list of elements that I can display for each entry:
	- title
	- link
	-content or summary
